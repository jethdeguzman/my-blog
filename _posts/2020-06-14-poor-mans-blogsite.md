It's been on my checklist for years to host my own blogsite. And finally it's live.

Hosting a website or a blogsite is not an easy task in terms of developing, maintenance and cost. But if you have money and don't want to spend much time dealing with all those stuff, there's a ton of services online that offers ready made solution that can setup your site instantly. But in my case I opted to a more practical solution, Github Pages.

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) allows you to host a website directly from a repository. With a few clicks you can have a website live in minutes. You can also deploy a blogsite using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a ruby-based static site generator. Since it's static, it loads fast. Another good thing is that they also allow custom urls, so you can access your site using a preffered domain name. How cool is that?

As a software engineer who knows how things work from developing, deploying and maintaining a website won't mind using a simple solution like Github Pages for my blogsite. In the end, what matter is that it's working and serving it's purpose.
