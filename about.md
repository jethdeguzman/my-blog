Hi, I'm Jethro.

I'm a decent software engineer. I love writing code for companies that impact the lives of people. I'm also a newbie trader. I trade stocks and crypto. I enjoy the thrill of losing my hard earned money (LOL). I created this blog to share my learnings and experiences in tech, trading and also in life.
